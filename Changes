1.005     2024-09-18 19:53:46+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [Bugs fixed]

    - after an error, the active query was left in place which caused further query attempts
    to stall (also raised by @ngeojiajun-deriv with a test case :+1:)
    - flow control is now applied immediately, to avoid a race condition where the first flow
    control event could be missed
    - flow control is also cleaned up properly, in some cases we could end up with the previous
    source still attached on the next query

1.004     2024-01-08 14:22:35+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [Bugs fixed]

    - for ->simple_query(), ensure we finish the row source, and pass through the Database::Async
    instance (otherwise you'd get errors about not being able to call ->new_future)
